# ICLR 2022 blog track

### Submission Details

I have forked the ICLR repo, so my file is at `_posts/2021-12-09-submission.md`. Using HackMD or another MarkDown viewer renders this file correctly.

Clicking `Human Cognition Inspired Word Segmentation Models.html` under `_posts/` also renders the HTML correctly, except it does not format it like a blog post, since it cannot pull ICLR's other dependencies.

The blog is also hosted at <https://shinjinighosh.github.io/iclr-blog-track.github.io/2021/12/09/submission/>, and this is definitely the best viewing experience (you could also check on the public GitHub repo that the last commit is pre-deadline).
